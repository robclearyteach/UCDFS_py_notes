"""
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. 
It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and 
dividing by the square of your height in meters. 
The interpretation of BMI for people 16 years or older is as follows:
+-------------+-----------------------+
| BMI         | Category              |
+-------------+-----------------------+
| < 18.5      | Underweight           |
| 18.5 - 24.9 | Normal weight         |
| 25 - 29.9   | Overweight            |
| >= 30       | Weight Issue (Class 1)|
